Use Weibull distribution:
W(x; 1.32, 32.9)

The 5-year ranges x to x+5 were converted to x+2.5.  This is only a first 
order approximation, and does not take slope into account.  However, more
precision is pure fantasy -- I can't match the data that well with a
distribution anyway.

I used R to fit distributions to the data. Weibull was the clear winner. 
I hand-tuned the Weibull distribution to
shape (k): 1.32
Scale (lambda): 32.9

Sadly, the tail is too thick. the CDF at 130 is only 0.995, so truncate 
at 125 and be happy that our Logan's Run remake has pushed the age back 
from 30.  The c_pop_pyramid_dist class can be replaced  if there is ever 
a later version.
